## Learning Objectives

### **1) What value of the Curie temperature did you obtain by fitting?**
T<sub>c</sub> = (1113.88 Â± 9.71, 0.8718%)K
       
### 2) **How close is this value to the expected value for iron?**
Expected value: 1043.15K (Source: [https://mse.engin.umich.edu/](https://mse.engin.umich.edu/internal/demos/curie-point-of-iron), Accessed Oct 2023)

The value obtained from the fit is not close enough to the expected value to be considered accurate as the expected value is outside the uncertainty range of the calculated value.

### 3) **What physical property of magnets determines the Curie temperature?**
       

### 4) **What effect do you think turning off the periodic boundaries will have on the Curie temperature and why?**
